usb-guard
=========

THIS TOOL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND DOESN'T WORK YET.

Tool for managing list of authorized USB devices on Linux.


USB Guard is to be considered "too hacky" at the moment and should get some code 
rewritten.


TODO:
* Make the list use Gtk.TreeView.
* Make the code less messy.
